# Geo-Orbit Thruster Optimization Script

## Overview
This Python script is designed to optimize the parameters for maximizing outlet thrust in a geostationary orbit (GEO) with minimal voltage. It focuses on finding the best combination of specific impulse and mass flow rate to achieve the highest thrust with the lowest power consumption, without utilizing the design principles of the Pocket Rocket.

## Features
- Calculation of thrust based on specific impulse and mass flow rate.
- Estimation of power consumption for different thruster configurations.
- Optimization algorithm to find the best parameters for maximum thrust and minimal power usage.
- Visualization of the thrust vs specific impulse relationship.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages (if not already installed):

## Usage
To run the script, simply execute it in a Python environment:

The script will output the optimal thrust, specific impulse, mass flow rate, and estimated power consumption. Additionally, a plot will be generated to visualize the thrust versus specific impulse.
